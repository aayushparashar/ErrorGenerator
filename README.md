# ErrorGenerator
This is a Java Project that takes as an input a sentence and then generates some typing errors in that sentence. 

The problem: 

You're writing code for an English activity in which the computer takes a passage and introduces a
few spelling errors for the player to find and correct. Write an error generator as a command-line
application.
The user should be able to input a sentence into the command line, and your program will output a
version with at least one spelling error introduced.
The misspelling needs to look like it could be a believable human error. (Don't worry about checking
if the misspelling generated is also a real word.)
